                <h3>Clarification of Task</h3>
                <p>A daily problem for people with restricted hearing capabilities is waking up in the morning with the use of an alarm clock since they are not able to hear it. Bonsommeil Inc. is an independent company that specializes in the development and design of assistive products for disabled people. In the interest of their business, the company is developing a product to assist awakening people at a set time with restricted hearing capabilities. The alarm-concept uses mechanical tactile impact instead of a sound. This innovative alarm-clock concept consists of an actuator to produce physical impact capable of waking up individuals with normal sensitivity, a fixture to attach the device to the individualâ€™s arm, and a compact electric driving unit suitable for integration with the impacting mechanism. As a design engineer, our task is to design the mechanical aspect of the impacting mechanism connected with the compact driving unit, select a standard driving unit, design a fixture that is robust yet provides gentle attachment for the actuator to the human arm, and produce detailed designs of any custom-made parts. In addition, the product designed must be as low-cost as possible, have as few parts as possible, and must ultimately meet all necessary safety requirements.</p>
                
                <h3>Conceptual Design</h3>
                <p>To address the needs of the client, I have designed a wristband alarm-clock that vibrates when set alarm time is reached thus awakening the individual. The impacting mechanism is actuated by a standard off-the-shelf DC electric motor. The motor is connected to the main shaft initiating rotation, the disc is fixed to the main shaft rotating in the same direction, the bar connecting link is attached to the disc and connects to the impacting bar which are both free to rotate as they like. Thus, producing a rapid reciprocating linear motion. The rubber end of the impacting bar repeatedly hits the bottom of the protective box producing vibration, awakening the client. The DC motor is fixed inside the protective box with two supporting blocks, supporting the rest of the impacting mechanism by the main shaft. A seamless rubber strap with a double snap fixture encases and fully integrates the protective box into the wristband. The alarm-clock interface is similar to that of a digital watch, consisting of a sleep button, and buttons to used to set the time.</p>
